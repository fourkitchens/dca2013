## Required gems

You may want to configure RubyGems to not install the unneeded RDoc stuff for each gem. To do that, add a `~/.gemrc` file and insert the following lines:

```
install: --no-rdoc --no-ri
update:  --no-rdoc --no-ri
```

In Terminal, run these commands to install everything you need:

```bash
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install jekyll
sudo gem install uglifier singularitygs jacket
```

## Git

We're not doing feature branches, so when you want to get upstream changes, use the rebase flag:

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

This will "rewind" your commits since your last pull, add the upstream commits, then "fast-forward" your commits back on top of the upstream changes. It may cause conflicts, but since upstream changes were already in the repo it was going to happen anyway.

## Jekyll server

In Terminal, run the following command to get a server started:

```bash
jekyll serve -w
```

The server will exist as long as your command is running. By default you go to http://localhost:4000/ to see your Jekyll site.

The ```-w``` argument means *watch* so now whenever you (or Sass) make changes to the filesystem, Jekyll will respond by regenerating a new copy of the site. Pretty cool, huh?

We have .gitignore excluding the ```_site``` directory that Jekyll creates because Github will take care of generating that folder when we push to ```gh-pages``` branch.

## JavaScript

To build the JavaScript, use `grunt` and `grunt watch`. To install the required npm modules, start with `npm install`. You may need to install node.js if you don't have it. It's easily downloadable from the http://nodejs.com website.

In _config.yml, there is a `debug` setting. Changing this to 'true' will use the non-minified versions of the JS. `false` will use the full minified production versions.

### The build pipeline

JS is kept in the `_js/` folder. This is ignored by Jekyll. Grunt builds the JavaScript (minimizes and concatenates it) and places the built files in the `js/` folder, which Jekyll *will* include in the site build.

In the JS source folder, there is a folder `/vendor`, which contains the minimized or unminimized versions of vendor script (e.g. jQuery and Ember), and sometimes both. We keep both in the case that the vendor provides an optimized version of their library that we can't reproduce using Grunt's minimize. For example, ember.min.js doesn't contain any assertions or debugging to reduce it's size even further than what you can achieve with a standard minimize.

The Grunt job cleans the `js/dist` folder by removing it completely. It then recreates the folder and it's contents.

## Content

### Naming conventions

Jekyll has a hard requirement for posts' file names. The required format is as follows: ```YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md``` â€” but... we don't want to bother with a valid date for most types of pages. So we're using fake, hardcoded dates for most content. News is the notable exception, which **should** contain the actual publish date.

```
News      YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md
FAQs      0002-02-02-faq-title.md
Sessions  0003-03-03-session-title.md
Workshops 0004-04-04-workshop-title.md
```
