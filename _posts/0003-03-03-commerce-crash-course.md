A Drupaler's introduction to the world of eCommerce. Join Josh Miller (a Commerce Guy since 2012) as he brings experienced Drupalers into the world of eCommerce.

Built lots of Drupal sites but want to start branching out into the "Commerce" side of the famous Content, Community, Commerce triangle? This talk is about eCommerce through the eyes of a web developer who "gets Drupal," but has never touched a cart or thought of SKUs.

Overview of various kinds of stores that are built on Drupal Commerce. A quick, but very informative look at how Commerce is structured to make the most use of entities, Views, Rules and every other awesome thing in Drupal.

Including, but not limited to the following:

- Learning using the Demo Store vs. Launching using Kickstart 2
- Customizing the Search API faceted search
- Exploring the Commerce Backoffice interface (quick editing, inline editing)
- Creating our own product type
- Using Oauth to allow customers sign up using Twitter / Facebook
- Working with the Taxonomy-based catalog menu links

and more!
