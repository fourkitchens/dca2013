This is the Absolute Beginner's Guide to Drupal. You'll learn all of the key concepts you need to understand, navigate and begin building a Drupal site. We've taught new Drupal users from the White House to Harvard and the New York Transit Commission to the small business owner.  We'll help it make sense.

* Part 1: Introduction to Drupal: What? Who? When? Why?
* Part 2: Installing Drupal
* Part 3: Navigating the Drupal interface
* Part 4: Understanding Drupal content
* Part 5: Managing Drupal content using content types
* Part 6: Adding data fields to Drupal content
* Part 7: Choosing and configuring modules
* Part 8: Choosing and configuring themes
* Part 9: Configuring and working with Drupal user permissions
* Part 10: Building a full Drupal site so that students can practice everything they learned during the class

Attendees will need a laptop with [Acquia's Dev Desktop](http://www.acquia.com/downloads) installed, if they wish to follow along with the tasks.
