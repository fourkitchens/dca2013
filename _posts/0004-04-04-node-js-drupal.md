Do you love Drupal but find that it's not the right platform for some of the realtime applications you want to build? Are all your friends having fun with Node.js and you want to be one of the cool kids (again)? This hands-on training course will teach you how to create a realtime web application in Node.js and Drupal. You'll write code all day :-)

After this class, you'll have written your first node.js application(s) and have integrated Node.js's realtime wizardry into Drupal's content management magic.

**Our Web Chefs will show you how to:**

* Improve your Javascript knowledge in our crash course in JS101
* Write your first node.js application from the ground up
* Understand how to use NPM node's world class package manager
* Write non-blocking asynchronous code and how to spot it's evil twin: synchronous blocking code
* Know what Node.js is good at and when a different tool is better
* Gain experience with the popular Node.js framework: Express
* Write API endpoints in Drupal to connect to your realtime application
* Write code that reads and writes data to and from your Drupal site.
* Understand the new Node.js Drupal module.
