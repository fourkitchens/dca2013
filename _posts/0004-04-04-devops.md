When you set up the environment for a new site, do you start with sudo apt-get, every time. When you deploy your code, do you do it manually, every time? Do you need to work with others but hate how they mess up your code?

Learn how to make the machine do the work. In this course, you’ll practice some “build once, use often” methods to improve collaboration, capture server configuration, and create automation. We’ll do less talk and more doing - with hands-on exercises and examples to build on, including:

* Collaborative development
* Version control for effective collaboration with Git
* Configuration management with Ansible
* Automation with Jenkins

### Prerequisites

**You must bring a Mac or Linux laptop.** (Unless you know how to run Ansible on your Windows machine, in which case, you probably know most of what we’ll teach.) Please be comfortable in the command line and have a basic working knowledge of version control, preferably Git.
