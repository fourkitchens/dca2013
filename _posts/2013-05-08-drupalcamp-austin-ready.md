Howdy everyone, the DrupalCamp Austin site is up and running! It’s a bit different than in years past but we’ve put a lot of TLC into this site and we think you’ll love using it.

### What’s different?

For starters, we’ve taken some critical functionality off our site and used other dedicated services to handle certain things. The main two are:

* Registration is [handled through EventBrite](http://drupalcampaustin.eventbrite.com/)
* Session submissions are [handled through Google docs](http://bit.ly/drupalatx-speak) ([Learn more](/sessions))

You may be thinking "wat.. Drupal can do this" and you’re not wrong, but we wanted to change things up this year so we could focus on packing more awesome features into a mobile-friendly site made just for YOU!

For now, you can [browse submitted sessions](/sessions), [read about the program and venue](/about), or if you have a question [read the FAQs](/faq).

See you soon!
