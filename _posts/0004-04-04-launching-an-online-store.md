Drupal Commerce is an open source eCommerce framework developed to help you create unique online shopping experiences. Its core modules provide the basic systems you need to do business online without hard-coding assumptions for any particular business model, allowing you to build sites that meet your business needs instead of getting in your way.

Built on top of Drupal Commerce, Commerce Kickstart 2.0 is a distribution of Drupal that installs a demo store out of the box, implementing a variety of eCommerce best practices and improving the store administrator user experience. It is feature-rich, including numerous contributed modules that add helpful functionality to Drupal Commerce.

In this course, you will learn how to launch your next online store with Commerce Kickstart 2.0 from project creators Commerce Guys. Through a series of alternating lessons and hands-on exercises, you will install the distribution, customize it, and prepare to launch your own fantasy store during this day long training. Handbooks will be provided, but each student should come prepared with a Drupal development environment on a laptop they can use for the duration of the training.

### Prerequisites

Attendees should have some eCommerce experience and be used to Drupal 7. Prior experience with Views and Rules is not required but is certainly helpful. Students looking to prepare should spend some time reading tutorials or watching videos about Rules 2, Views 3, or Drupal Commerce itself.
