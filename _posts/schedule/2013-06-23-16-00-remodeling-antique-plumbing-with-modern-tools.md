This talk is targeted at developers of all experience levels, although it shouldn't get so technical that a beginner would be completely lost.

I will be looking at problems with old technology, such as developing around the 31 stylesheet limitation in old versions of IE, HTML4 class and ID naming issues, dealing with aging and confusing codebases without breaking or re-coding existing deployed sites and methods of retrofitting modern coding and deployment strategies onto existing sites while the plane is still in the air.
