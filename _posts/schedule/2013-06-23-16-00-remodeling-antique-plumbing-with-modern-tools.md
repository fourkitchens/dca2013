Spacer gifs and 8.3 filenames are a thing of the past, but the internet is still full of sites are that built around them.  If you ever need to work on a codebase of a sufficient age, what are the old pitfalls and modern workarounds?

I will be looking at some of the problems you are likely to encounter with old technology, such as developing around the 31 stylesheet limitation in old versions of IE, HTML4 class and ID naming issues, dealing with aging and confusing codebases without breaking or re-coding deployed sites, and methods of retrofitting modern coding and deployment strategies onto existing sites with minimal downtime.

This is web development at the trailing edge!
