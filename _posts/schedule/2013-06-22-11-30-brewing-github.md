GitHub just turned 5 years old. During that time, it grew from a small team of **4** to **171** employees all over the globe, working on their own schedules, and without any managers.

This talk will dive into how GitHub ships: how we ship GitHub's culture, how we work day to day, how we get everyone at GitHub (including business teams) to use Git & Github, and how you can use these workflows in your company today.
