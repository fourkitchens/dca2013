Frontend development is changing, and themers need the right tools to create performant, mobile-first sites. Starting to navigate the many modules, CSS preprocessors and libraries out there can be incredibly overwelming. But have no fear, we are here to bring some *magic* back into your project with some tools to improve your development workflow.

This session will introduce the [Magic module](http://drupal.org/project/magic), and the tools that it provides all front endgineers to develop their site. The Magic module was created by the maintainers of Aurora and Omega, with contributions from Zen and Mothership to share tools that we all need to speed up theme development. We will also go over the tools that [Team-Sass](http://www.github.com/Team-Sass) has built to allow rapid development of your site.
