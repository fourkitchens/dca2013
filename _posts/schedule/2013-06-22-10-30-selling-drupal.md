Not everyone has made the Drupal decision. Companies don't buy Drupal, but sometimes we still have to sell it - organizations must still buy -into- it. Platform decisions take engagement across an organization - from marketing to IT. Selling Drupal takes striking a balance - it's much more than a product and often a different approach. We'll discuss overcoming the challenges of selling Drupal against proprietary platforms and how to counter the FUD and land-mines offered by other systems (and the agencies that use them).

We'll talk about where Drupal wins and loses and how we can change the game with stronger tools and different tactics - leveraging Drupal's advantages and approach to win business and working across groups within the organization.
