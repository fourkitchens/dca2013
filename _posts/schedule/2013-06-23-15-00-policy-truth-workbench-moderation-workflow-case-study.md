This session is a case study of Four Kitchens' work with UT Austin's Policy Office on a custom policy publishing and approval workflow. The business problems faced by the policy office require a lot of flexibility and wide discretion in terms of workflow, presentation, and access.

We will take a look at the benefits and shortcomings of Workbench, Workbench Moderation and Workbench Access for command and control organizations as well as non-editor review workflows. Then through working code examples demonstrate some techniques you can use to expand draft review capabilities to non-editors, use Workbench Access to drive other access control and inventively turn Workbench on its head for bespoke workflows.
