The Demo Framework is a new distribution that highlights powerful features created by our community. It is intended to be used as a starterkit for promoting enterprise-ready Drupal solutions. It uses modules from popular distributions like Spark, Commerce Kickstart and Panopoly to deliver an engaging web experience management solution.

### Topics

- Case Study - delivering ""Wow thru visual storytelling"" through a live demonstration.
