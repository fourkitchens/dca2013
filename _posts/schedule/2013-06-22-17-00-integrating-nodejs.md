track: Development

day: Saturday

This talk will cover the use of the [Node.js integration module](http://drupal.org/project/nodejs). This module provides an API that allows Node.js functionality to be tightly coupled with a Drupal installation. The aim is to provide a possible alternative to the Drupal/Node.js as a service type model. The talk will be targeted at developers, and will be structured around demonstrations and code snippets of increasing complexity. Hopefully, an attendee will leave with some extra tools in their Node.js/Drupal toolbox, and a bit more insight into the possibilities of Node.Js with Drupal.
