Over the past few years, Marketing Automation has exploded in popularity and use in corporations and non-profits across nearly every vertical. It has become a crucial piece of the Digital Marketing equation and an opportunity for Drupal as more customers are looking for new and creative ways to bridge content with customer to increase engagement.

This session will cover:

* What can marketing automation do,
* Using Marketing Automation data to hyper-customize a Drupal website,
* Increasing measurable, bottom-line outcomes for Drupal website owners,
* Integrating with other marketing technologies like SEO or PPC,
* Combining the power of marketing automation and Drupal to produce "wow" results.
* Lead management, nurturing, and scoring
* and answer any questions you might have.

If you're not aware of the full capabilities that a marketing automation platform (like Automatr, Marketo, Eloqua, Pardot, etc) brings to the party then this session will be very valuable to you. I you're experienced in these platforms then you will see the benefits of a deeper integration between your content strategy and your Drupal website.
