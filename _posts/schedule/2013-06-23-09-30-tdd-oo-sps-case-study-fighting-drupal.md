Erik Summerfield will explore the benefits of Test Driven Development that he saw in writing the [SPS module](https://drupal.org/project/sps) and how an Object Oriented approach helped make this process work. We will discuss some of the challenges of doing Test Driven Development in Drupal, and how we worked through them using OO ideas. We'll also explore some of the place where the OO paradigm did not mesh with the Drupal architecture, and how we overcame these challenges.
