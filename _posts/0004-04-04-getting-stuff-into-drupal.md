Almost anyone with a bit of Drupal knowledge can build a functional Drupal site these days, but what happens when it's time to get the last 5 years of your organization's content into that snazzy new site? More often than not, the solution involves hiring outside help or migrating content manually (ugh). Fortunately, the Drupal community has written some amazing tools to assist with content migration, and this workshop will demonstrate how to utilize them. Examples of migrating data from comma-separated-values files (via the Feeds module), Drupal 6 to Drupal 7 (via the Migrate module), and from an generic MySql database (also via the Migrate module) will form the basis for the workshop. Participants can expect to leave the workshop with confidence that they can tackle their next data migration project.

### Prerequisites

Participants should have a good base knowledge of Drupal fundamentals for the Feeds migration portion of the workshop. The Migration module examples will involve a generous amount of object-oriented PHP code.
