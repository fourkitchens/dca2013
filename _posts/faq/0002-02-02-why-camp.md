title: Why is the event a "camp"?
---

DrupalCamp Austin is called a "camp" to emphasize the [unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) style of the event. Unconferences are more casual than most conferences and are usually organized and attended by members of a local community. The name originates from [BarCamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp), a popular community-driven unconference.
